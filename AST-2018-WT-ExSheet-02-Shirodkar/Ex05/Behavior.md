The time taken by the code to count till different limits of numbers roughly follows the factor.  
For instance, the time taken by the code to enlist the prime numbers till 1000 is around 14ms, to enlist prime numbers till 2000 
will not exactly be double but it is somewhere around 34ms and the time to list prime numbers till 10000 will be 330ms. 

Thus we can conjecture that based on the resources available to the processor, the time taken by the program to count prime numbers
roughly follow the pattern given above.
