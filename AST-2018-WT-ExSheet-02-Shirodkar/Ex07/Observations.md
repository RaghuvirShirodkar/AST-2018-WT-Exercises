## Observations for exercise 07:
As the value of <i>k</i> is increased, the value of the function approaches unity.
For lower values of k, the value obtained from the function depends on the <i>difference between the value of n and k</i>.

To compute the value of <i>f(n+1)</i>, given the value of <i>f(n)</i>, we can make use of the value of <i>f(n)</i>, and recursively add the next value, to obtain the value of <i>f(n)</i>.
